      <summary>Naruto Uzumaki</summary>

      <p>
        Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
        Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
        recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
        of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in
        Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens
        (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto:
        Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in
        Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).

            A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden
            leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi
            Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and
            the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals
            the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making
            him a host of the beast.[i] The Third Hokage returns from retirement
            to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by
            Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a
            decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events,
            Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later,
            when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto
            defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka
            Umino.[ii] Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with
            Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on
            whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei,
            the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every
            village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,
            ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing
            assassinations. After several missions, including a major one in the
            Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling
            them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult
            missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a
            wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for
            revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the
            title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he
            chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead. During the search, it is
            revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his
            powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts
            and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who had showed up in
            Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from
            him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when
            Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including
            Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or
            force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke;
            Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare
            himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes
            Tsunade's apprentice.

            Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with
            Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful
            Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and
            search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing
            and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts
            except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays
            Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in
            battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had
            been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a
            coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared.
            Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy
            Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members,
            the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates
            Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's
            respect and admiration. With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as
            Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he
            wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful
            enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders
            of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join
            forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in
            a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five
            Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's
            forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto,
            unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure
            (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the
            island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time,
            Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed
            Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield. During the
            conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former
            teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara
            saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke
            learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led
            to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and
            rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans.
            However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an
            ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed
            Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is
            sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation
            and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal
            of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to
            dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in
            a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war,
            Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes.
            Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga
            and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.

        <p>
          Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with
          his family in the mountains. After his father's death, he became his
          family's breadwinner and travels to the nearby village to sell
          charcoal. One day, Tanjiro comes home to discover his family was
          slaughtered by a demon. His sister Nezuko is the sole survivor of the
          incident; though she has been transformed into a demon, Nezuko still
          shows signs of human emotion and thought. Following an encounter with
          Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjiro is
          sent to train with Giyu's former instructor Sakonji Urokodaki in
          becoming a Demon Slayer and begins his quest to help Nezuko turn into
          a human again. Two years later, Tanjiro learns the "Water Breathing"
          style and takes part in a formidable exam. He is one of the few to
          pass, officially making him a member of the Corps. Sakonji has
          hypnotized Nezuko to not harm humans and she aids Tanjiro in dire
          situations as he starts his work of hunting down and slaying demons.
          One of their assignments bring them to Asakusa where they encounter
          Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible
          for the murder of their family. Tanjiro and Nezuko also meet Tamayo
          and Yushiro, two demons free from Muzan's control. They ally to
          develop a cure for Nezuko, though it will require Tanjiro to supply
          Tamayo with blood samples from the Twelve Kizuki, the twelve most
          powerful demons under Muzan's command, split into the six Lower Ranks
          and the six Upper Ranks. Along their journey, Tanjiro and Nezuko meet
          fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira; they team
          up after Tanjiro's mission to kill Kyogai, the former Lower Six. They
          later join other Demon Slayers in facing the family of Lower Five Rui.
          In the midst of battle, Tanjiro unlocks a mysterious Breathing Style
          known as "Hinokami Kagura", but Rui ultimately outmatches him, while
          Inosuke and Zenitsu are injured and the expedition is slaughtered.
          Giyu and Insect Hashira Shinobu Kocho rescue the survivors, who are
          brought back to the Corps' headquarters. Tanjiro is put on trial by
          the Hashira – Giyu, Shinobu, Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku, Sound
          Hashira Tengen Uzui, Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji, Stone Hashira
          Gyomei Himejima, Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito, Serpent Hashira Obanai
          Iguro, and Wind Hashira Sanemi Shinazugawa – who, with the exception
          of Giyu and Mitsuri, do not believe he and Nezuko should be allowed to
          live. Nonetheless, the Corps' leader Kagaya Ubuyashiki, is able to
          convince them to accept Nezuko and see Tanjiro's importance, believing
          it is with their help that Muzan can be defeated. Angered by Rui's
          death, Muzan kills the Lower Ranks due to their constant failures; he
          spares Lower One Enmu and tasks him with killing Tanjiro. After a
          battle against Enmu in a passenger train, Tanjiro kills him with
          Kyojuro's support. However, Upper Three Akaza appears and battles
          Kyojuro, who dies from his wounds as the demon escapes. Months later,
          the group is sent to Yoshiwara with Tengen, where they face off and
          kill the Upper Six siblings Gyutaro and Daki. Tengen retires from the
          Corps after suffering extensive injuries. During another battle at the
          Swordsmith Village, where the Corps' weapons are forged, Tanjiro meets
          Sanemi's younger brother Genya, who has the mysterious ability to
          temporarily gain demonic powers after eating their flesh. With the
          help of Muichiro and Mitsuri, the group kill Upper Five Gyokko and
          Upper Four Hantengu. In the aftermath, they discover that Nezuko is
          immune to sunlight. She becomes Muzan's prime target as he has long
          sought a way to overcome the sun and become immortal. Tanjiro also
          learns his Hinokami Kagura descends from "Sun Breathing", the first
          Breathing Style created by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the most powerful Demon
          Slayer in history, and develops it to fight Muzan. Kagaya forecasts
          Muzan's intentions and enacts a strict training regimen to prepare the
          Corps for the coming battle. Tamayo develops a serum with the obtained
          blood samples to cure Nezuko, who is kept in isolation as she
          recovers. Muzan appears and Kagaya triggers a suicide attack to
          stagger him. The Hashira ambush Muzan but he traps them all within the
          Infinity Castle, an endless labyrinth housing Akaza, Upper Two Doma,
          Upper One Kokushibo, and the newly-ascended members Kaigaku and
          Nakime: Zenitsu's former partner and Muzan's personal assistant
          respectively. As Zenitsu kills Kaigaku, Tamayo injects Muzan with a
          poison she and Shinobu have made to weaken his abilities. When Akaza
          remembers his human life, he betrays Muzan and commits suicide, while
          Shinobu sacrifices herself to poison Doma, allowing her protégé Kanao
          Tsuyuri and Inosuke to kill him. After a harrowing battle, Kokushibo
          kills both Muichiro and Genya before being killed as well. Muzan kills
          Tamayo, and later Nakime when she is hypnotized by Yushiro to use her
          powers against him, but he is forced above ground by the Corps. Aided
          by Tamayo's poison, the Corps unleash a desperate battle of attrition
          as the remaining members fight to stall Muzan until the morning sun
          can kill him. Muzan is left helpless against the sun but Gyomei,
          Obanai, and Mitsuri succumb to their injuries. As Tanjiro delivers the
          final blow, Muzan fatally wounds him and forcefully gives him his
          remaining blood. Tanjiro is transformed into a demon as Muzan's
          last-ditch effort to have his species survive. He begins to attack the
          survivors but through their efforts and Nezuko's aid, who has been
          fully restored to her human self, the transformation is reversed. In
          the aftermath of the battle, the Corps are disbanded, leaving Giyu and
          Sanemi as the last surviving Hashira. Muzan's death has effectively
          vanquished all demons under his control while Yushiro goes to live as
          a painter. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their home, accompanied by
          Zenitsu and Inosuke. Tanjiro and Inosuke marry Kanao and fellow Demon
          Slayer Aoi Kanzaki, respectively, while Zenitsu marries Nezuko. In a
          modern-day epilogue, the descendants and reincarnations of the Corps
          members enjoy a peaceful life free of demons.

      <summary>Death Note</summary>
      <p>
        Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by
        Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. It was serialized in
        Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2003
        to May 2006, with its chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes. The
        story follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who discovers a
        mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami
        Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose
        name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's
        subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide
        massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free
        society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the
        subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by
        enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him.

        <summary>Plot</summary>
        <p>
          In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds
          the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook with rules that can end
          anyone's life in seconds as long as the writer knows both the target's
          true name and face. Light uses the notebook to kill high-profile
          criminals and is visited by Ryuk, a "shinigami" and the Death Note's
          previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the
          notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world
          out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.[5] Global media
          suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious
          murders and name them "Kira" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of
          the word "killer"). Interpol requests the assistance of the enigmatic
          detective L to assist in their investigation. L tricks Light into
          revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him
          to kill a decoy. Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing
          his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese
          police investigation, led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. L
          assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those
          connected with the investigation and designates Light as the prime
          suspect. Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light
          into the Kira Task Force. Actress-model Misa Amane obtains a second
          Death Note from a shinigami named Rem and makes a deal for shinigami
          eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the
          cost of half her remaining lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her
          boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira. Light
          uses her love for him to his advantage, intending to use Misa's
          shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely
          the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he
          does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he
          and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has
          Rem pass the Death Note to Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With
          memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and,
          together with L, deduces Higuchi's identity and arrests him. Light
          regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi,
          regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories,
          Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast
          suspicion on Misa. Rem realizes Light's plan to have Misa sacrifice
          herself to kill L. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light
          obtains her Death Note. The task force agrees to have Light operate as
          the new L. The investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop.
          Four years later, cults worshipping Kira have risen. L's potential
          successors are introduced: Near and Mello. Mello joins the mafia
          whilst Near joins forces with the US government. Mello kidnaps
          Director Takimura, who is killed by Light. Mello kidnaps Light's
          sister and exchanges her for the Death Note, using it to kill almost
          all of Near's team. A Shinigami named Sidoh goes to Earth to reclaim
          his notebook and ends up meeting and helping Mello. Light uses the
          notebook to find Mello's hideout, but Soichiro is killed in the
          mission. Mello and Near exchange information and Mello kidnaps Mogi
          and gives him to Near. Kira's supporters attack Near's group, but they
          escape. Aizawa becomes suspicious of Light and meets with Near. As
          suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to Teru
          Mikami, a fervent Kira supporter, and appoints newscaster Kiyomi
          Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Near has Mikami followed whilst
          Aizawa's suspicions are confirmed. Realizing that Takada is connected
          to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light.
          Near arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force
          members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task
          force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been
          replaced with a decoy. Near proves Light is Kira discovering Mikami
          had not written down Light's name. Light is wounded in a scuffle and
          begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes
          down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day
          they met, and Light dies. One year later, the world has returned to
          normal and the Kira Taskforce Members are conflicted over whether they
          made the right decision. Meanwhile, cults continue to worship Kira.
